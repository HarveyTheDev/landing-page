A project to create a landing page.

I don't actually expect anyone to read this, but if you're interested, this is my second project from the Odin Project and my first time building something that resembles a real webpage from complete scratch. I learnt a lot throughout this project. I reinforced my flexbox learning and how to properly structure a HTML document, gained knowledge on how to incorporate fixed backgrounds, and learned a lot of new styling techniques in CSS.

When you compare this landing page to my first project (Odin Recipes), it shows just how far I've come in a relatively short period of time.

Please note, this project is not yet optimized for mobile devices.
